# projects
I have three projects as of right now and I am working on even more side projects. My first projerct is a simple game and my second one is a account managing system and my third project is a hotel reservation system. The following are the three projects:


1. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:
This interactive coding project allows users to engage in a thrilling game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Players are presented with three choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Upon making their selection, the program randomly determines the computer's choice from the same options.
The outcome of the game is then revealed to the player, indicating whether they emerged victorious or not.





2. Bank Account Management System:
The Bank Account Management system is an object-oriented program that provides users with a menu-driven interface, offering a variety of options for account management.

  The menu encompasses seven intuitive choices:
  1. Load from an existing array: Allows users to import account data from an existing array.
  2. Insert a new account: Enables users to add a new account to the system.
  3. Search account by year: Facilitates searching for specific accounts based on the account's associated year.
  4. Update account: Provides functionality to update account details as per the user's input.
  5. Delete account: Allows users to remove an account from the system.
  6. Print All Accounts: Displays a comprehensive list of all existing accounts.
  7. Save the existing Accounts: Enables users to store the current account data into a text-based file for future reference.

  Upon selecting an option from the menu, the program executes the corresponding functions, seamlessly performing the desired actions. 
  Once all the necessary operations are completed, the program either presents the requested information to the user or conveniently saves the accounts into a text-based file for record-keeping purposes.


  

3. Hotel Reservation System
  This project is a console-based Hotel Reservation System developed using the C++ programming language. It is designed with the objective to automate the many facets of hotel reservations, ranging from adding and deleting customers to updating customer information and conducting searches. The system provides a user-friendly interface, making it accessible for hotel staff with varying degrees of technical knowledge.

The main functionality of this system is encapsulated in a menu-driven interface. The menu presents six options to the user:

1. Add Customer
2. Delete Customer
3. Update Customer
4. Search Customer
5. Print All Customers
6. Exit

When adding a customer, the user is prompted to enter the full name of the customer, the check-in date, and the check-out date. This data is then stored in a structure. The 'Delete Customer' function allows the user to remove a customer's record from the system by specifying the customer's full name. The 'Update Customer' function allows for the alteration of an existing customer's details. This could include extending their stay, changing the check-in or check-out dates, or correcting any errors in the initial entry.
The 'Search Customer' function offers the user the ability to find a specific customer's information by inputting the customer's full name. This tool can be particularly useful for quickly accessing a guest's reservation details without having to manually sift through the entire customer database.
The 'Print All Customers' function displays the list of all customers currently stored in the system, including their full names and reservation dates. This function can serve as a quick overview of all guests currently residing in the hotel.
Lastly, the 'Exit' option provides the user with a simple way to safely close the application.
By providing an efficient and organized system for handling hotel reservations, this project aims to improve customer service and streamline administrative processes. By utilizing the powerful features of C++, such as data structures, file handling, and object-oriented programming, this system can handle large volumes of data, providing quick and efficient results for its users.
