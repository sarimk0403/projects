# projects
I have two projects as of right now and I am working on even more side projects. My first projerct is a simple game and my second one is a managing system. The following are the two projects:

1. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:
This interactive coding project allows users to engage in a thrilling game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Players are presented with three choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Upon making their selection, the program randomly determines the computer's choice from the same options.
The outcome of the game is then revealed to the player, indicating whether they emerged victorious or not.

2. Bank Account Management System:
The Bank Account Management system is an object-oriented program that provides users with a menu-driven interface, offering a variety of options for account management.

  The menu encompasses seven intuitive choices:
  1. Load from an existing array: Allows users to import account data from an existing array.
  2. Insert a new account: Enables users to add a new account to the system.
  3. Search account by year: Facilitates searching for specific accounts based on the account's associated year.
  4. Update account: Provides functionality to update account details as per the user's input.
  5. Delete account: Allows users to remove an account from the system.
  6. Print All Accounts: Displays a comprehensive list of all existing accounts.
  7. Save the existing Accounts: Enables users to store the current account data into a text-based file for future reference.

  Upon selecting an option from the menu, the program executes the corresponding functions, seamlessly performing the desired actions. 
  Once all the necessary operations are completed, the program either presents the requested information to the user or conveniently saves the accounts into a text-based file for record-keeping purposes.
